# ReadySet Demo

This demo sets up a ReadySet instance and a sample database on your local machine using Docker.

<Callout>If you want to connect ReadySet to your own database, please follow the directions in 
the [install ReadySet](/get-started/install-rs) documentation.</Callout>

<Callout>Before starting, make sure you have Docker Engine version >= 19.03.0 and Docker Compose V2 OR 
Docker Desktop >= 4.1.0 and the [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html) or 
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) client installed.</Callout>

<Tabs items={['Postgres', 'MySQL']}>

**1. Download and run the ReadySet Docker compose file**

```sh copy
curl -L -o compose.yml                                  \
  "https://readyset.io/quickstart/compose.postgres.yml" \
  && docker compose pull                                \
  && docker compose up -d
```

**2. Import sample data**

```sh copy
curl -L -s "https://readyset.io/quickstart/imdb-postgres.sql" \
  | psql 'postgresql://postgres:readyset@127.0.0.1:5433/testdb'
```

<Callout type="warning">
Data loading will be slow on Macs with Apple Silicon.
</Callout>

**3. Connect and explore the dataset**

Connect to ReadySet.

```sh copy
psql 'postgresql://postgres:readyset@127.0.0.1:5433/testdb'
```

Enable query timing.

```sh copy
\timing
```

Run a sample query. Note that since we have not created a cache, this query is served directly by Postgres.

```sql copy
SELECT count(*) FROM title_ratings
JOIN title_basics ON title_ratings.tconst = title_basics.tconst
WHERE title_basics.startyear = 2000 AND title_ratings.averagerating > 5;
```

You'll see similar results:

```sql
 count
-------
  2418
(1 row)

Time: 154.980 ms
```

**4. Cache a query!**

<Callout type="warning">
Query performance will be slow on Macs with Apple Silicon.
</Callout>

Using the `CREATE CACHE FROM` SQL extension, cache the query in ReadySet like so:

```sql copy
CREATE CACHE FROM SELECT count(*) FROM title_ratings
JOIN title_basics ON title_ratings.tconst = title_basics.tconst
WHERE title_basics.startyear = 2000 AND title_ratings.averagerating > 5;
```

Now that ReadySet is going to cache the query, run the same query to populate the cache:

```sql copy
SELECT count(*) FROM title_ratings
JOIN title_basics ON title_ratings.tconst = title_basics.tconst
WHERE title_basics.startyear = 2000 AND title_ratings.averagerating > 5;
```

Same results as earlier:

```sql
 count(*)
----------
     2418
(1 row)

Time: 154.980 ms
```

This most recent query ran against Postgres, but now the ReadySet cache has been populated.  
Run the query again and this time it's served by ReadySet:

```sql
 count(*)
----------
     2418
(1 row)

Time: 2.073 ms
```

**5. View Cached Queries**

Use the `SHOW CACHES` command to see which queries are currently being cached by ReadySet:

```sql
      query id      |     cache name     |                       query text                       | fallback behavior | count
--------------------+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-------
 q_bccd97aea07c545f | q_bccd97aea07c545f | SELECT                                                +| fallback allowed  | 4
                    |                    |   count(*)                                            +|                   |
                    |                    | FROM                                                  +|                   |
                    |                    |   "title_ratings"                                     +|                   |
                    |                    |   JOIN "title_basics" ON (                            +|                   |
                    |                    |     "title_ratings"."tconst" = "title_basics"."tconst"+|                   |
                    |                    |   )                                                   +|                   |
                    |                    | WHERE                                                 +|                   |
                    |                    |   (                                                   +|                   |
                    |                    |     ("title_basics"."startyear" = $1)                 +|                   |
                    |                    |     AND ("title_ratings"."averagerating" > 5)         +|                   |
                    |                    |   )                                                    |                   |
(1 row)
```

**6. Update the underlying data**

You'll notice that query you've run a few times returns the count of movies in '00 that had a rating greater than 5 (i.e. 2,418 movies). 
"Battlefield Earth" was a movie released in '00 that received poor ratings. For instance, run this query:

```sql copy
 SELECT title_basics.tconst, title_basics.primarytitle, title_ratings.averagerating, title_ratings.numvotes 
 FROM title_basics                                                
 INNER JOIN title_ratings on title_ratings.tconst = title_basics.tconst                                                                                                               
 WHERE title_basics.primarytitle = 'Battlefield Earth';
```

You'll see it scored an average rating of 2.5:

```sql
  tconst   |   primarytitle    | averagerating | numvotes
-----------+-------------------+---------------+----------
 tt0185183 | Battlefield Earth |           2.5 |    80451
(1 row)

Time: 63.621 ms
```

It was, indeed, an awful movie. Nevertheless, historical revisionism is fun when you have 
full control of the data. You can grab the id for "Battlefield Earth" (`tt0185183`) and update its
average rating accordingly: 

```sql copy
UPDATE title_ratings
SET averagerating = 5.1
WHERE tconst = 'tt0185183';
```

**7. The cache is auto-updated!** 

Rerun the previously cached query that returns the count of movies: 

```sql copy
SELECT count(*) FROM title_ratings                                                                                                                                         
JOIN title_basics ON title_ratings.tconst = title_basics.tconst                                                                                                                      
WHERE title_basics.startyear = 2000 AND title_ratings.averagerating > 5;
```

And bingo! The count has been increased by one (i.e 2,419 vs 2,418). 

```sql
 count(*)
----------
     2419
(1 row)

Time: 2.617 ms
```

**1. Download and run the ReadySet Docker compose file**

```sh copy
curl -L -o compose.yml                                  \
  "https://readyset.io/quickstart/compose.mysql.yml"    \
  && docker compose pull                                \
  && docker compose up -d
```

**2. Import sample data**

```sh copy
curl -L -s "https://readyset.io/quickstart/imdb-mysql.sql" \
  | mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -P3307 testdb -preadyset
```

<Callout type="warning">
Data loading will be slow on Macs with Apple Silicon.
</Callout>

**3. Connect and explore the dataset**

Connect to ReadySet.

```sql copy
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -P3307 testdb -preadyset
```

Enable query timing.

```sql copy
set profiling=1;
```

Run a sample query.

Note that since we have not created a cache, this query is served by MySQL.

Query:
```sql copy
SELECT count(*) FROM title_ratings
JOIN title_basics ON title_ratings.tconst = title_basics.tconst
WHERE title_basics.startyear = 2000 AND title_ratings.averagerating > 5;
```

Results:
```sql
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|     2418 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.69 sec)
```

**4. Cache a query!**

<Callout type="warning">
Query performance will be slow on Macs with Apple Silicon.
</Callout>

Using the `CREATE CACHE FROM` SQL extension, cache the query in ReadySet.

```sql copy
CREATE CACHE FROM SELECT count(*) FROM title_ratings
JOIN title_basics ON title_ratings.tconst = title_basics.tconst
WHERE title_basics.startyear = 2000 AND title_ratings.averagerating > 5;
```

Now that ReadySet is going to cache the query, run the query to populate the cache.

Query:
```sql copy
SELECT count(*) FROM title_ratings
JOIN title_basics ON title_ratings.tconst = title_basics.tconst
WHERE title_basics.startyear = 2000 AND title_ratings.averagerating > 5;
```

Results:
```sql
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|     2418 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.69 sec)
```

That query ran on the database, but now the ReadySet cache has been populated.  Run the query again, and this time it is served by ReadySet.

Results:
```sql
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|     2418 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
```

**5. View Cached Queries**

Use the `SHOW CACHES` command to see which queries are currently being cached by ReadySet:

```sql
mysql> show caches;
+--------------------+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-------+
| query id           | cache name         | query text                                                                                                                                                                                           | fallback behavior | count |
+--------------------+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-------+
| q_cb4448c088a2c2f6 | q_cb4448c088a2c2f6 | SELECT count(*) FROM `title_ratings` JOIN `title_basics` ON (`title_ratings`.`tconst` = `title_basics`.`tconst`) WHERE ((`title_basics`.`startyear` = $1) AND (`title_ratings`.`averagerating` > 5)) | fallback allowed  | 2     |
+--------------------+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
```

**6. Update the underlying data**

You'll notice that query you've run a few times returns the count of movies in '00 that had a rating greater than 5 (i.e. 2,418 movies). 
"Battlefield Earth" was a movie released in '00 that received poor ratings. For instance, run this query:

```sql copy
 SELECT title_basics.tconst, title_basics.primarytitle, title_ratings.averagerating, title_ratings.numvotes 
 FROM title_basics                                                
 INNER JOIN title_ratings on title_ratings.tconst = title_basics.tconst                                                                                                               
 WHERE title_basics.primarytitle = 'Battlefield Earth';
```

You'll see it scored an average rating of 2.5:

```sql
  tconst   |   primarytitle    | averagerating | numvotes
-----------+-------------------+---------------+----------
 tt0185183 | Battlefield Earth |           2.5 |    80451
1 row in set (0.62 sec)
```

It was, indeed, an awful movie. Nevertheless, historical revisionism is fun when you have 
full control of the data. You can grab the id for "Battlefield Earth" (`tt0185183`) and update its
average rating accordingly: 

```sql copy

```

**7. The cache is auto-updated!** 

Rerun the previously cached query that returns the count of movies: 

```sql copy
SELECT count(*) FROM title_ratings                                                                                                                                         
JOIN title_basics ON title_ratings.tconst = title_basics.tconst                                                                                                                      
WHERE title_basics.startyear = 2000 AND title_ratings.averagerating > 5;
```

And bingo! The count has been increased by one (i.e 2,419 vs 2,418). 

```sql
+----------+
| count(*) |
