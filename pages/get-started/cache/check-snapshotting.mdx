# Check Snapshotting

When you first connect ReadySet to your database, ReadySet stores a snapshot of your database tables on disk and then keeps this snapshot up-to-date by listening to your database's replication stream. **Queries can be cached in ReadySet only once all tables have finished the initial snapshotting process.**

Since snapshotting can take between a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size of your dataset, ReadySet gives you various ways to check the snapshotting status:

- [Check overall status](#check-overall-status): Run a custom SQL command to check the overall snapshotting status.
- [Check per-table status](#check-per-table-status): Run a custom SQL command to check the snapshotting status of each table in the database that ReadySet is connected to.
- [Track detailed progress](#track-detailed-progress): Check log messages to track the snapshotting progress and estimated time remaining for each table.

## Check overall status

To check ReadySet's overall snapshotting progress, connect a SQL shell to ReadySet and run the following custom SQL command:

``` sql copy 
SHOW READYSET STATUS;
```

``` {.text .no-copy}
name            |   value
----------------+----------
Snapshot Status | Completed
(1 row)
```

This command returns either `In Progress` or `Completed` as the snapshotting status.

## Check per-table status

To check the snapshotting status of each table in the database that ReadySet is connected to, connect a SQL shell to ReadySet and run the following custom SQL command:

``` sql copy 
SHOW READYSET TABLES;
```

``` {.text .no-copy}
         table            |    status
------------------------------------------
`public`.`title_basics`   | Snapshotting
`public`.`title_ratings`  | Snapshotted
`public`.`title_episodes` | Not Replicated
(3 rows)
```

This command returns a virtual table with 2 columns:

- **Table:** The name of the table in the database that ReadySet is connected to.
- **Status:** The snapshotting status of the table. There are 3 possible statuses:
    - **Snapshotting:** The initial snapshot of the table is in progress.
    - **Snapshotted:** The initial snapshot of the table is complete. ReadySet is replicating changes to the table via the database's replication stream.
    - **Not Replicated:** The table has not been snapshotted by ReadySet. This can be because ReadySet encountered an error (e.g., due to unsupported data types) or the table has been intentionally excluded from snapshotting (via the [`--replication-tables`](/reference/cli/readyset#--replication-tables) option).
